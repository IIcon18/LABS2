Well, that brings me to the end of the presentation. So, just to recap, parents often enroll their children in sports
schools early due to aspirations for fame and success, early talent identification, and the benefits of physical and
mental development. However, young athletes face challenges such as physical strain, burnout, academic sacrifice,
and social isolation. At the peak of their performance, athletes contend with injury risks, financial stress,
public scrutiny, and the short-lived nature of their careers. Many athletes leave sports due to physical decline,
burnout, financial instability, identity crises, new opportunities, personal growth, and health concerns.
